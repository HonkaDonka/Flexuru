When I first heard about flexible PCBs, I knew I wanted to make something related to origami. 

I wanted to make something similar to a badge; a pcb that includes an e-ink display, some buttons, and other peripherals. 

Later, I decided to make it a flex PCB that's able to fold into a crane. Why a crane? Well, it's one of the first things that come to mind when talking about origami!

Originally, I went with a hybrid-flex approach, where it would be a PCB that had a couple of flex sections. However, it was way too pricey and instead I decided on a pure flex PCB with stiffener. 

First, I folded an actual origami crane and created a crease pattern from it through [Oriedita](https://oriedita.github.io/).

This will later help me map out where to place components. 

Doing some research, it seems that flex PCBs should minimize the amount of copper going through folds, so I decided to take inspiration from [e-textiles](https://www.connectortips.com/what-connectors-are-there-for-woven-electronics-e-textiles-faq/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), specifically the connectors. 

I think my current plan is to utilize pogo-pin-like connectors to route signals and power through the PCB. This way, there would be no copper running through the PCB creases AND it also does the favor of keeping creases together.
